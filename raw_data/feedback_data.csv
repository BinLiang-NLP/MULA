anonymous,anonymous,53,sql: improve precision of index spans to scan for multi-column-family single-row fetches,"Suppose we have a table and a query:    ```  CREATE TABLE a (a INT PRIMARY KEY, b INT, c INT, FAMILY(a), FAMILY(b), FAMILY(c);  INSERT INTO a VALUES(1,2,3);    SELECT b FROM a WHERE a=1;  ```    Currently, this query will cause a scan from `/a/primary/1 -> /a/primary/2`, even though ideally we'd only need to scan the key at `/a/primary/1/b`.    We have enough information to improve this scan, since we know that `c` is not a needed column, `a` is the primary index and therefore unique, and we have an equality constraint on `a`.
